# fall-detector
This project is fall detection system, using a threhold method. A Machine Learning approach should be added soon. An arduino Nano 33 BLE was used as an IMU.
Once a fall is detected, a notification is sent via the installed app as an SMS to a designated person. 
The connection between the Arduino and the user mobile phone is maed via BLE.
The app was built using MIT App Inventor for rapid prototyping.
